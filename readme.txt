Special Thanks to: 
crossproduct, for the original version of the Crystalis Randomizer EmoTracker pack.
The EmoTracker Discord, for helping me figure out how to work with EmoTracker, and how to make it do things it probably isn't supposed to. :)
The Crystalis Randomizer Discord for entertaining obscure logic questions in my attempt to make this as accurate as possible
donpete, for providing the East/GBC Cave detail map.

Info:
This is a map and item tracker that attempts to account for all possible combinations of flags that affect logic. This is meant for use with the latest branch of the randomizer, found at https://crystalisrandomizer.com/latest/. As such, the logic of the tracker may not match exactly the logic of the game if you are using the stable version of the randomizer. 

Some notes on usage: 
	-in this pack, a yellow location means the tracker does not have enough information to tell you whether or not you can access that location. Generally, this happens because of the Me, We, Wt, or Wu flags. 
	-For the Me and We flags, use the Walls/Bosses/Misc tab to indicate which bosses you can beat and which walls you can clear. 
	-For the Wt and Wu flags, you can right-click on the relevant key items once you know what purpose they actually fill. 
	-If playing without the Rt flag, you can right click on the Sword of Thunder to cycle through all the possible warp points, to show you what you have access to. 
	-If using the Wg flag, you can use the Goa Floor items on the Walls/Bosses/Misc tab to indicate the shape of your Goa Fortress. Left-click to cycle through bosses, and right-click to reverse the floor, indicating the boss of that floor is closer to the entrance than the exit.
	-If using the Wm flag, individual sub-maps will have doors that can be clicked once to indicate that you have found that door, or twice to indicate the door is blocked by the map structure.  When you have the ability necessary to reach that door regardless of the structure, the door locations should disappear from the map.
	-To set up autotracking, you'll need to be using BizHawk and to have a version of the connector.lua for EmoTracker that works with your current version of BizHawk. If you're having trouble finding it, I recommend visiting the EmoTracker Discord (specifically the channel #autotracker-support) and asking for help there. Once you have the correct lua connector, open your Crystalis Randomizer ROM in BizHawk, go to Tools -> Lua Console in BizHawk, and select Open Script in the window that appears. Load the connector lua there, leave that window open. Then, right click on the robot in the bottom-right corner of EmoTracker and select NES -> Lua. If everything is connected correctly, the robot head should turn a nice light teal, and your flags should be automatically read from the ROM. At that point, you're ready to start playing.

Flags that show as a red X when selected are currently not implemented in the logic.

Version History:

v1.0.0
	- First release. Implements most flags that affect logic.
v1.0.1
	-Removed the default background colors for better NDI capture support
	-Added negative indicators for key items; the logic will now account for the items in the tracker that you don't have. e.g. if you have an unknown key, and you mark one of the keys you don't have as the Key to Styx, the logic will know that you don't have the Key to Styx, but you might have the Key to Prison or the Windmill Key.
	-commented out some debug statements
	-made the whitespace more consistent
v1.0.2
	-Added logic and tracking for Vampire 2
	-Added hosted item for Sabera 1 location
	-Added hosted item for Karmine location
v1.0.3
	-Added tracking reset for Vampire 2 when finding a new sword
v1.1.0
	-Major Update: added Wm logic.
v1.1.1
	-Fixed a typo that broke checking for Mesia's message when Rage wants the Sword of Fire.
	-Fixed a minor logic bug about the Medical Herb chest on Mt. Sabre West
v1.1.2
	-Added support for unidentified bows under the Wu flag
	-Added Rabbit Boots as an in-logic way to cross hazardous terrain
v1.1.3
	-Fixed Draygon 1 logic; Draygon 1 now only requires any sword, flight, and Saraha access to beat.
	-Added East Cave detail map
v1.2.0
	-Added a ChatHUD compatible variant of the pack.  It does not support the Wt (randomized trade-ins) or Wu (unidentified key items) flags, and will not automatically reset boss or wall tracking when finding new swords and sword upgrades, but it should work for all other cases.
	-Additional fix to Draygon 1 logic - apparently, the official logic is that Draygon 1 requires a sword if Nw is on, or any level 2 weapon if Nw is off.  The tracker now officially reflects that.
v1.2.1
	-Added support for the new Mg (Oops, All Mimics!) flag
v1.2.2
	-Fixed a logic bug with the Gn flag
v1.3.0

Future Release Plans:
	Wh flag logic
	Ww flag logic
	Wa flag logic
